        <h1>What I Love Doing</h1>
        <p>
          I‚Äôm a developer who enjoys bringing ideas to life through code. My
          main focus is frontend development, where I design and build
          intuitive, responsive user interfaces. I enjoy working with modern
          tools like React and Tailwind CSS, and I‚Äôm always looking for ways to
          improve performance and user experience. I'm also exploring backend
          development and creating decentralized apps on the Solana blockchain.
          But there‚Äôs more to me than just code. I love playing music while I
          work ‚Äî it keeps me in the flow. I play footbal, and playing drums is
          one of my favorite ways to relax and stay active. Whether I‚Äôm on the
          field or behind the screen, I bring energy, focus, and creativity to
          everything I do. ‚ÄúCode is my craft, but rhythm keeps me moving on the
          keyboard, the drums, or the pitch.‚Äù

        <h2 class="head_container">My Journey Into Coding</h2>
        <p>
          My journey into coding started thanks to a good friend of mine who‚Äôs a
          full-stack developer. At the time, I was simply someone who loved
          computers. I enjoyed exploring software, customizing settings, and
          just figuring out how things worked behind the scenes. But I had never
          written a line of code. One day, my friend showed me how he built a
          website from scratch. I was amazed not just by what he created, but by
          the idea that I could build something real and useful with just a
          laptop and a bit of code. That moment lit a spark. I started learning
          frontend development, diving into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It wasn‚Äôt
          easy, but the joy of building something from nothing kept me going. I
          now specialize in creating responsive, user-friendly websites that
          look great and perform even better. Every project I build is a
          reminder of why I started: a love for computers, a passion for clean
          design, and the drive to always keep learning.
